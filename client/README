    This directory is part of s3c2440adc project, and
provides a client. It was written in Qt5, receives the
data with fixed format from server(Another part of this
project), and extracts the datagram, then represents
with dot diagram, line diagram or pillar diagram. You
and also output operation log depend on your requisition.

    From the starting of developing, the target of this part 
was just to implements a oscillometer-like application for
represents ADC data, but it also be capable of handling
the other data source(e.g. using random number as data
source When testing.), but may be have to modify something: 

    1. fyyoscillometer/src/dataitem.h. The type of data
       field is type of uint32_t, if your data can be negative
       number, or other type, modify it. And, since server and
       client have the same data format, you have to do the
       same work on the same file in server part.

    2. fyyoscillometer/src/fyymon.h. Two macros need one's
       attention: DATA_RAW2VALUE and CONVERT_TO_Y_POSITION, 
       the former is a formula for converting the raw data 
       to value, the latter be used to convert raw data to 
       Y position in XY-coordinate system, yep, the latter
       requires the former. Modify them to be suited to your
       platform.
