    This directory is the libraries part of project fl2440_adc.
it provides three APIs for convenient reading ADC value.


struct s3cadc * s3cadc_alloc(int32_t ch);
    Open ADC device file and return a pointer to structure s3cadc, 
    the argument ch specifies a channel number.
    The struct s3cadc represents a ADC device, all ADC operations 
    need an object of it.

void s3cadc_destroy(struct s3cadc *);
    s3cadc_alloc() dynamically  allocates memory, when finish sampling,
    s3cadc_destroy() reclaim this memory area. and close the file 
    descriptor.

s3cadc_get_adc(struct s3cadc *, buf); 
    It is a macor wraps the system call read. Just using like read(read(2)).

Note: You should copy libraries to target machine by yourself.
